The BMI calculator is a simple app built with basic javascript and Bootstrap framework to calculate the body mass index of a user. 

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measurement of a person’s weight with respect to his or her height. It is more of an indicator than a direct measurement of a person’s total body fat.BMI, more often than not, correlates with total body fat. This means that as the BMI score increases, so does a person’s total body fat. The WHO defines an adult who has a BMI between 25 and 29.9 as overweight - an adult who has a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese - a BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight, and between 18.5 to 24.9 a healthy weight.BMI is used by healthcare professionals to screen for overweight and obese individuals. The BMI is used to assess a person’s health risks associated with obesity and overweight.

BMI is calculated with the mathematical formula;

**BMI** = **Weight** in kilograms divided by **Height** in metres squared
